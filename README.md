# Config and some scripts randomly added
* zshrc config file. Copy it in ~/.zshrc
* simple script to change heic to jpg 
* port scanner with 2 modes, range of ports and allports, only tcp yet, **personal note: lots of eamples for me there**
* Ports to clip is useful to go faster after 1st nmap scan, name not definitive.
* Connection.sh is useful for Google courses on cursera, or in general changing permit to +600 & copying to clipboard a ssh connection command using a file as authentication
* In frontend/ I am saving random files or notes about html or javascr. course I started
* SamplesFolder contains example-files for procceses, such as .heic images

# TODO
